This repository contains a PHP code example demonstrating an uncommon error related to handling non-numeric values in an array during summation. The `calculateSum` function fails to handle non-numeric input, resulting in unexpected behavior or runtime errors.  A solution is provided in `bugSolution.php` which addresses the issue by implementing proper input validation and error handling.
